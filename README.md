## General info
Learning what is a stack. A simple program with a main menu allows to choose useful functions demonstrating what a stack is, how it works and how to interact with it: `pop(), push(), size(), empty()`.
* `push()` - adds an element on top of the stack
* `pop()` - deletes an element from the top of the stack
* `size()` - shows how many elements there are currently on the stack
* `empty()` - shows if the stack is empty

## Technologies
* C++
* CodeBlocks (IDE)
* GNU GCC Compiler (minGW)
